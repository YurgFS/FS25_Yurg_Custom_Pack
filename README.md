# Recommend Mods

Here is a list of mods I do recommend:
- https://www.kingmods.net/en/fs25/packs/3529/recommended-mods


# Compatibility issues

**Unlimited Color Configurations** [#1](https://github.com/YurgFS/FS25_Yurg_Custom_Pack/issues/1)

It is messing up with some of the “material type” settings on some vehicles.

Issue 0027127 still on going on GIANTS Software side. (it is one of their mods)

**Working width mods**

It is not recommended to use mods that update the working with of equipments, as some of them will not take the actual width into account and set a fixed value.
Like this one:
- **Increased Work Areas for Pickups**

**Pallets mods**

It is not recommended to use mods that update pallets as it may interfere with this mod, and specially those ones:
- **Liftable Pallets And Bales**
- **Larger capacity pallets**
