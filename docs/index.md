## Compatibility issues

Please avoid mods that update the color list without first checking if it is a Material Type list and not a Color list.

- `Unlimited Color Configurations` by GIANTS Software [#1](https://github.com/YurgFS/FS25_Yurg_Custom_Pack/issues/1)

Please avoid mods that update the working width of equipments with some fixed value without first checking if the current value is higher or not.

- `Increased Work Areas for Pickups` by Ifko[nator] [#49](https://github.com/YurgFS/FS25_Yurg_Custom_Pack/issues/49)

Please avoid mods that update pallets as it may interfere with this mod.<br>*And specially the Livestock pallets (x10) if you are using the updated barns because the pallet spawn area will be too small.*
