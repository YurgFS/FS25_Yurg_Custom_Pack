### A few tips to help you find the root cause
If you are unsure, you can try the following method, this might help you find the root cause of the problem:
- create a new game with [a dedicated test map](https://github.com/YurgFS/FS25_Yurg_Dev_Map/releases/latest) having this mod as the only activated one.
- if everything is fine, restart the test map by adding other mods until the problem re-occurs.

You may do the same with your main game, but be very careful, do not save and beware of auto save.
You will have to make a backup of the game save folder as the first step. You will find it in Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\savegameX with X as the game save slot between 1 and 20.
