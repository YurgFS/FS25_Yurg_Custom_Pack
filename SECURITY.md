# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version is currently supported for security updates.

But since this is a mod for Farming Simulator, it's highly unlikely that there will be a security issue with the mod itself.

Farming Simulator security issues are the responsibility of its publisher, GIANTS Software.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a security problem occurs because of this mod and not because of the game (which is highly unlikely), please:
- create an “[other request](https://github.com/YurgFS/FS25_Yurg_Custom_Pack/issues/new?template=other_requests.yml)” issue.

If a security problem occurs because of the game, please use GIANTS Software issues tool:
- https://feedback.giants-software.com/

But do not expect an answer from them before a very very long time, and  if any.
